How to enable GitHub's https authentication in Ubuntu/Debian


1) Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) in GitHub, copy the token (will be invisible thereafter)

2) Install GitHub CLI to securely store the token and avoid entering the token each time we need to access the CLI: 

a) https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git
b) https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md

3) Done
