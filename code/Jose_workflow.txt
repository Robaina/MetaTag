General idea
-------------

We will create a tree to place environmental short reads on,so we can assign both function and taxonomy to these reads
more accurately than one could achieve with a database like ReqSeq.

How? First, we create a database of sequences for our gene of interest (GOI). These sequences are obtained via pfam/tigr
running a hmmer search.


Jose's workflow 
--------------

1. Run clean.py (reformat labels)
2. Run loopparallel.py (prodigal)
3. Run reformatlabel.py (makes long labels)


TESTING:
--------

1. clean.py works
2. loopparallel.py works
3. reformatlabel.py works
4. pfamgenomesparallel.py works
