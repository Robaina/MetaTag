General idea
-------------

We will create a tree to place environmental short reads on,so we can assign both function and taxonomy to these reads
more accurately than one could achieve with a database like ReqSeq.

How? First, we create a database of sequences for our gene of interest (GOI). These sequences are obtained via pfam/tigr
running a hmmer search.

Workflow:

1. Get peptides database, clean sequences and/or tags
2. Filter GOI-specific peptide sequences via HMMs (pfam or tigrfam)
3. Align GOI-specific sequences (.phylip file)
4. Reconstruct GOI-specific phylogenetic tree
5. Place environmental (translated) short reads onto phylogenetic tree

Jose's workflow 
--------------

1. Run clean.py [Clean DNA sequences and reformat labels]

2. Run loopparallel.py [Translate DNA sequences into peptides with prodigal]

3. Run reformatlabel.py [Edit peptide labels in fasta file to include meta]

3. Run 0MusclePep.py [Get multiple peptide alignments ".phylip" file]

4. Run fasttree or iqtree in bash [Get phylogenetic tree, requires .phylip file]

5. Run papara ij bash [Place environmental short reads (translated?) onto tree]


4. Placement with papara


TESTING:
--------

1. clean.py works
2. loopparallel.py works
3. reformatlabel.py works
4. pfamgenomesparallel.py works
