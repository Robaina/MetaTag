## :bulb: What is MetaTag?
This repository contains tools to assign taxonomy and function annotations to short reads through pylogenetic tree evolutionary placement

## :wrench: Setup
The easiest way to use MetaTag is through the provided [docker](https://www.docker.com/) container. To use it, pull the image:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/robaina/metatag:latest
```

Then run the container interactively:

```
docker run -i ghcr.io/robaina/metatag:latest
```

Otherwise, you can install MetaTag like this:

1. Fork git repo into local machine (click on fork) and clone, or simply clone main branch with
```
git clone https://github.com/Robaina/TRAITS.git
```
2. CD to project traits and set conda environment if not already set:
```
conda env create -n traits -f envs/metatag.yml
```

## Installation test
To check that everything is working properly, you can run a test what will perform the entire workflow on a minimal dataset. To run it, call bash script:
```
bash tests/run_test.sh
```
It should produce a final tree with query sequences placed on it, as well as a bunch of intermediary files without any errors.
